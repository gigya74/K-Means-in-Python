K-Means in Python

*How to do K-Means Data Clustering in Python and Find the best K?*

A very common task in data analysis is that of grouping a set of objects into subsets such that all elements within a group are more similar among them than they are to the others. K-Means is one of the most popular “clustering” algorithms. K-means stores k centroids that it uses to define clusters. A point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster’s centroid than any other centroid.
